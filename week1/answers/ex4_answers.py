Changing The Albanach's status to 'full' in mcp_venue_server.py caused it to
disappear from all search results automatically. In Query 1, search_venues
returned 1 match instead of 2; the agent still found the correct answer (The
Haymarket Vaults) without any guidance. In Query 2, The Albanach was also
absent when the agent probed lower capacity thresholds.

No changes were needed to exercise4_mcp_client.py, the tool bridge code, or
the tool schemas. Only mcp_venue_server.py was edited. The agent picked up the
updated data at runtime because each MCP call spawns a fresh server process
reading the current file — there is no caching or redeployment step.
